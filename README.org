* Making changes 
  When making changes to the sources, always make them in the develop branch.  To
  test your changes, run =make stage= that will build the changes and copy the
  changes to =staging-dev.vlabs.ac.in=.  Once the changes are finalized, merge
  changes to master and run =make export= that will build and copy the files to
  =vlabs-dev.vlabs.ac.in=.

  Never make changes in the =master= branch.
