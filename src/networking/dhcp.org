* DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that
 automatically assigns TCP/IP information to client machines.  Each
 DHCP client connects to the centrally located DHCP server, which
 returns the network configuration (including the IP address, gateway,
 and DNS servers) of that client.
** Why we use DHCP ?
 DHCP is useful for automatic configuration of client network
 interfaces. When configuring the client system, you can choose DHCP
 instead of specifying an IP address, netmask, gateway, or DNS
 servers. The client retrieves this information from the DHCP
 server. DHCP is also useful if you want to change the IP addresses of
 a large number of systems. Instead of reconfiguring all the systems,
 you can just edit one configuration file on the server for the new
 set of IP addresses.  If the DNS servers for an organization changes,
 the changes happen on the DHCP server, not on the DHCP clients. When
 you restart the network or reboot the clients, the changes go into
 effect.

If an organization has a functional DHCP server correctly connected to
a network, laptops and other mobile computer users can move these
devices from office to office.
** Advantages of DHCP-Server:
  -  There is no need to manually configure each client with an IP address.
  -  You don't need to keep a record of the IP addresses that you have assigned.
  -  You can automatically assign a new IP address if you move a client to a different subnet.
  -  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign IP addresses and other stuff like gateway and DNS details automatically to the clients.
  
we need a DHCP server configured for offering ipaddress to the clients when it is required.
* Installing DHCP server on Centos:
  -  Update yum repositories and packages by typing the below command
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# yum update
#+end_example
*Step 1* » Install dhcp server and client using the below command
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# yum install dhcp
#+end_example
*Step 2* » After installing dhcp server package along with dependencies .Assign a static ip (eg: “192.168.1.11”) in the same DHCP range for
the listening interface ( eg : “eth0” ). Open =/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0= file and make the changes as per your requirement .
#+begin_example
HWADDR="00:0C:29:F1:01:4B"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
BOOTPROTO="none"
IPADDR=192.168.1.11
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
#+end_example
*Step 3* » Now open =/etc/sysconfig/dhcpd= file and add the preferred interface name to DHCPDARGS variable as below
#+begin_example
# Command line options here
DHCPDARGS=eth0
#+end_example
*Step 4* » open =/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf= file and paste the below lines and save it.
#+begin_example
#specify domain name
option domain-name "krizna.com";
#specify DNS server ip and additional DNS server ip
option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.10, 208.67.222.222;
#specify default lease time
default-lease-time 600;
#specify Max lease time
max-lease-time 7200;
#specify log method
log-facility local7;
#Configuring subnet and iprange
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.254;
option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
#Default gateway ip
option routers 192.168.1.1;
}
#Fixed ip address based on MAC id
host Printer01 {
hardware ethernet 02:34:37:24:c0:a5;
fixed-address 192.168.1.55;
}
#+end_example
*Step 5* » Now start the service
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# service dhcpd start
#+end_example
and type this below command to start dhcp service automatically while booting.
#+begin_example
[root@localhost ~]# chkconfig --levels 235 dhcpd on
#+end_example
