* Introduction to OSI Model
- OSI model is based on the proposal developed by the International
  Standards Organization (ISO).
- This model is called ISO OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)
  Reference model because it deals with connecting open systems
  (systems that are open for communication with other systems)
- We call it as OSI Model.
** Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Model
- The OSI model describes how data flows from one computer, through a
  network to another computer
- The OSI model divides the tasks involved with moving information
  between networked computers into 7 smaller, more manageable sub-task.
- A task is then assigned to each of the seven OSI layers.
- Each layer is reasonably self-contained so that the tasks assigned
  to each layer can be implemented independently.
** Whye 7-layers OSI model
*** Why 7 layers?
  + To reduce complexity, networks are organized as a stack of layers, one below the other
  + Each layer performs a specific task. It provides services to an adjacent layer
  + This is similar to the concept of a function in programming languages ¡V function does a specific task
* The layers of the OSI Model

** Encapsulation/De-encapsulation
- The process of moving data between layers of the OSI Model
- *Encapsulation:* Data > segment > packet > frame > bits
- *De-encapsulation:* Bits > frame > packet > segment > data
** How Data Is Referred to in the OSI Model
- *Data* : Application, presentation and session layers
- *Segment* : Transport layer
- *Packet* : Networking layer
- *Frame* : Data link layer
- *Bits* : Physical layer
** The layers of the OSI model
*** Physical layer
[[./physical-layer.jpg]]
- One of the major function of the physical layer is to move data in the form of electromagnetic signals across a transmission medium.
- Its responsible for movements of individual bits from one hop (Node) to next.
- Both data and the signals can be either analog or digital.
- Transmission media work by conducting energy along a physical path which can be wired or wireless

*Examples:* Cables, connections and hubs reside over the network layer.
**** Functions of Physical Layer:
- *Bit representation* – encode bits into electrical or optical signals
- *Transmission rate* – The number of bits sent each second 
- *Physical characteristics* of transmission media 
- *Synchronizing* the sender and receiver clocks
- *Transmission mode* – simplex, half-duplex, full duplex
- *Physical Topology* – how devices are connected – ring, star, mesh, bus topology
*** Data Link layer (Host to Host)
[[./data-link-layer.png]]
- Responsible for delivery of data between two systems on the same network
- It receives the data from network layer and creates FRAMES , add physical address to these frames & pas them to physical layer 
- Encapsulation = frame
- Requires MAC address. or physical address
- Protocols defined include Ethernet Protocol and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
- It consist of 2 layers:
 + *Logical Link Layer (LLC) :* Defines the methods and provides addressing information for communication between network devices.
 + *Medium Access Control (MAC):* establishes and maintains links between communicating devices.

*Device example*: Switch
**** Functions of this layer are:
- *Framing* – divides the stream of bits received from network layer into manageable data units called frames.
- *Physical Addressing* – Add a header to the frame to define the physical address of the source and the destination machines.
- *Flow control* – Impose a flow control – control rate at which data is transmitted so as not to flood the receiver (Feedback-based flow control)
- *Error Control* – Adds mechanisms to detect and retransmit damaged or lost frames. This is achieved by adding a trailer to the end of a frame
*** Network Layer (Source to Destination)
[[./network-layer-header.jpg]]
- The network layer is responsible for the delivery of individual packets from the source host to the destination host.
- Requires logical addresses such as IP addresses
- If two systems are attached to different networks with devices like routers, then N/W layer is used.

*Device example*: Router
**** Functions of this layer are:
- Responsible for delivery of packets across multiple networks
- *Routing* – Provide mechanisms to transmit data over independent networks that are linked together.
- Network layer is responsible only for delivery of individual packets and it does not recognize any relationship between those packets
*** Transport Layer (Process to Process)
[[./transport-layer.jpg]]
- The transport layer is responsible for the delivery of a message from one process to another.
- TL looks after the delivery of entire message considering all its packets & make sure that all packets are in order. On the other hand n/w layer treated each packet independently.
- At the receiver side, TL provides services to application layer & takes services form n/w layer.
- At the source side, TL receives message from upper layer into packets and reassembles these packets again into message at the destination.
- Transport Layer provides two types of services:
  + *Connection Oriented Transmission:* In this type of transmission
    the receiving devices sends an acknowledge back to the source
    after a packet or group of packet is received. It is slower
    transmission method.
  + *Connectionless Transmission:* In this type of transmission the
    receiving devices does not sends an acknowledge back to the
    source. It is faster transmission method.
**** Functions of this layer
- Responsible for source-to- destination delivery of the entire message
- *Segmentation and reassembly* – divide message into smaller segments, number them and transmit. Reassemble these messages at the receiving end.
- *Error control* – make sure that the entire message arrives without errors – else retransmit.
*** Session Layer (Dialog initiation)
[[./session-layer.jpg]]
- It has the responsibility of beginning, maintaining and ending the communication between two devices, called session.
- It also provides for orderly communication between devices by regulating the flow of data.
- Concerned with how data is presented to the network
- Handles three primary tasks:
  + Translation
  + Compression
  + Encryption
**** Functions of this layer
- *Establishing, Maintaining and ending a session*- When sending
  device first contact with receiving device, it sends syn
  (synchronization) packet to establish aconnection & determines the
  order in which information will be sent. Receiver sends ack
  (acknowledgement). So the session can be set & end.
- *Dialog control* – allows two systems to enter into a dialog, keep a track of whose turn it is to transmit
- *Synchronization* – adds check points (synchronization points) into stream of data.
*** Presentation Layer (dependency)
[[./presentatin-layer.jpg]]
- It is concerned with the syntax & semantics of the information exchanged between the two devices.
- The presentation layer is responsible for translation, compression and encryption
- *Translation*- Changes data so another type of computer can understand it
- *Compression*- Makes data smaller to send more data in same amount of time
- *Encryption*- Encodes data to protect from interception or eavesdropping.
*** Application Layer (user level service)
[[./application-layer.jpg]]
- It is the topmost i.e. seventh layer of OSI Model.
- It enables the user to access the network.
- It provides user interface & supports for services such as e-mail, file transfer, access to the world wide web.
- So it provides services to different user applications.
- *Examples*-
  + Firefox web browser uses HTTP (Hyper-Text Transport Protocol)
  + E-mail program may use POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) to read e-mails and SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) to send e- mails
**** Functions of this layer
- *Mail Services:* This application provides various e-mail services.
- *File transfer & Access:* It allows users to access files in a remote host, to retrieve files from remote computer for use etc.
- *Remote log-in:* A user can log into a remote computer and access the resources of that computer.
- *Accessing the World Wide Web:* Most common application today is the access of the World Wide Web.
