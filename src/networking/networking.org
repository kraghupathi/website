- This document about the basics of networking concepts 
- Here I choose Cisco Packet Tracer tool developed by =Cisco Organization= to
  understand more about networking formation, packet simulation and server configuration.
* Network:
- Network can be defined as a group of computers which are inter connected
  together to exchange the data.
- Sample network diagrame
[[./network.png]]
* Network Topology:
- Network topology is the arrangement of the various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. 
  Essentially, it is the topological structure of a network and may be depicted physically or logically.
 * EX := Bus Topology, Tree Topology, Ring Topology and Star Topology.
* LAN(Local Area Network):
- A LAN is a type of computer network in which networking facility is available in a small physical area (mostly in meters but very rarely in kilometers) probably in an office building, home and 
  school etc. Each computer or device connected to the network is called as a node.
** Uses of LAN:
-  LAN is useful for sharing resources like files, printer service, games or other applications.
** Examples of LAN:
- =Vlead Network= is an example of a LAN.
* WAN(Wired Area Network):
- A wide area network, or WAN, occupies a very large area, such as an entire country or the entire world. A WAN can contain multiple smaller networks, such as LANs or MANs. 
 * Ex := The Internet is the best-known example of a public WAN.
* Internet Protocol (IP):
- Internet Protocol is a unique address which is used to identify the
  computer/machine on a network.
- Which is used to identify the location of the computer in the world.
* IPV4:
- IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol Version 4. which uses 32-bits for address
  space and this uses TCP/IP host addressing mechanism.
- In which total address space is divided into 4 octets. Each octet value in
  decimal is 0-255.
 * Ex1 := 11000100.10101010.10101111.11010101
 * Ex2 := 175.56.43.23
- The above ip-address is in the dotted decimal number format. An ip address is in the format of 4 sets of decimal numbers separated by dots. The decimal number in each and every set is in the range 0 to 255. 
  Each and every set is called octet. So, there are 4 octets in an ip address.
** IP address classes:
- IPV4 address space is divided into several categerios for efficiant use of total address sapce. 
- Each class allows for a range of valid IP addresses, shown in the following table.
** Public IP:
- A public IP address is an IP address that can be accessed over the Internet. Like postal address used to deliver a postal mail to your home.
- A public IP address is the globally unique IP address assigned to a computing device.
 * Ex := 175.101.8.162
** Private IP:
- A private IP address is the address space allocated by InterNIC to allow organizations to create their own private network.
 * Ex := 10.2.59.109
** Static IP:
- Static IP is a fixed ip,it will not change
** Dynamic IP:
- It is an IP address is which is assigned by the DHCP server over network and
  it may change over time.
* Network Classes:
| CLASS A |   1.0.0.1-126.255.255.254 |  For Internet communication          |
| CLASS B | 128.1.0.1-191.255.255.254 |              Same as class A         |
| CLASS C | 192.0.1.1-223.255.254.254 |              Same as class A         |
| CLASS D | 224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255 | Reserved for Multicasting            |
| CLASS E | 240.0.0.0-254.255.255.254 | used for researching and experiments |
+ CLASS A 
 - First 8 bits indicates Network
 - Laster 24 bits indicates Host Address
+ CLASS B 
 - First 16 bits indicates Network
 - Laster 16 bits indicates Host Address
+ CLASS C 
 - First 24 bits indicates Network
 - Laster 8 bits indicates Host Addres
* IPV6:
- IPv6 stands for Internet Protocol Version 6. which uses 128-bits for address space and IPV6 denoted by eight groups of hexadecimal quartets separated by colons in between them.
 * Ex := 2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652
* Port:
- which specifies the process in the machine
- Port values range from 0-65535
* Port Numbers for given following Protocols:
| SSH   |    22 |
| HTTP  |    80 |
| HTTPS |   443 |
| FTP   | 20/21 |
| SMTP  |    25 |
| DNS   |    53 |
| DHCP  |    67 |
* Protocol:
- A Protocol is a set of rules which governs the communication between two
  computers which are connected by the network.
 * Ex := IP, HTTP and FTP etc.
** HTTP:
- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Which is responsible for
  loading/transfer the web data over internet.
- All browsing communication will happens using =http= protocal only.
- This protocal uses =80= protocal.
 * Ex := A browser is an HTTP client because it sends requests to an HTTP
   server (Web server), which then sends responses back to the client.  The
   standard (and default) port for HTTP servers to listen on is 80.
** FTP(File Transfer Protocol):
- The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol, which is
  used to transfer computer files between a client and server on a computer
  network.
- This will use port number 20/21

*Ex:-* Python File Sharing Server.
** SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):
- SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is generally used to
  send messages from a mail client to a mail server.
- This will use 25 port number. 
** TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol):
- TCP/IP is the basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. 
- It can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network
* VPN(Virtual Private Network):
- A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network technology that creates a secure network connection over a public network such as the Internet or a 
  private network owned by a service provider. And VPN can connect multiple sites over a large distance just like a Wide Area Network (WAN).
* Gateway:
- A gateway is a hardware device that acts as a "gate" between two networks. It
  may be a router, firewall, server, or other device that enables traffic to
  flow in and out of the network.
- A router is an example of a gateway device. A router is a device that does
  routing and decides where packets are sent to based on its IP address.
* Netmask:
- A netmask is a 32-bit number which is used to define how many bit of an IP
  address are related to hosts and network
- Netmask is used to define subnets and specify the network's available hosts.
- Netmask is used to identify the network address using binary operation with
  an ip and netmask.
| CLASS A |     255.0.0.0 |
| CLASS B |   255.255.0.0 |
| CLASS C | 255.255.255.0 |
* PING:
- Ping is a networking utility program. Which is used for verification of IP
  connectivity to the remote machine. This uses ICMP packets.
- To check connection between your machine to google.com server we use below command.
#+begin_example
ping www.google.com
#+end_example
* Apache Web server:
- Apache Web Server is an open source Web server for creation, deployment and management web applications.
- Which is designed to host one or more Web applications,
- It is also widely used by Web server many companies uses this server to host their internal web applications by configuring shared/virtual hosting,
  as by default, Apache Web Server supports and distinguishes between different hosts that reside on the same machine.
+ To install Apache-server on Linux, use the following command
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
sudo apt-get install apache2
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
yum install httpd
#+end_example
** How to host a website on Apache Server?:
1) To start the apache server, use the following command:
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
service apache2 start
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
service httpd start
#+end_example
2) To restart the server
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
service apache2 restart
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
service httpd restart
#+end_example
3) Open web browser and type =localhost= or =127.0.0.1= then, browser displays
   the default apache page. 
4) Create a sample html, js and css files and place them in a folder.
 
5) Move the contents of the folder to  =/var/www/html= or =/var/www/=. This is
   the default web host server for apache server.
6) Open browser and type =localhost/<file name> or 127.0.0.1/<file name>.
#+begin_example
localhost/example.html
#+end_example
7) To stop the apache server, use the following command:
 * On Ubuntu/Debian.
#+begin_example
service apache2 stop
#+end_example
 * On RHEL/CENTOS
#+begin_example
service httpd stop
#+end_example
