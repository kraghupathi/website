** Project Name : Porting the image processing lab to JavaScript
** Number of positions : 2
** Objective
*** Month 1:
 - Study the lab (experiment). understand the interfaces, document flow diagrams - 2 weeks

 - Study and understand the C/C++ to JS bitcode converter - 1 week.

 - Identify the porting changes (or simple PoC) -  1 week.

 - *Outcome:* A document with recommendations on porting or even to consider pure JS based image processing libraries. 

*** Month 2:
 - If Porting is recommended: Complete Porting of C/++ to JS - 2 weeks to 3 weeks.

 - Main challenge will be in handling threads - else, the porting should be straight forward.

 - Test (Manually) - 2 weeks and fix bugs.

 - *Outcome:* Image processing library should run in the browser and documentation of the process.

 - *Additional effort:* Automate the testing if time permits.

*** Tools to use:
 - Compilers: LLVM 

 - OS: Linux

 - C/C++ to JS: EmScripten (http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/)

** Project Name : Building/Collating image assets for Virtual Labs.
** Number of positions : 2

** Objective
The Virtual Labs projects needs collation of various image assets.  In
many cases, such image assets will need to be built using WebGL and
Web component technology.  Proper API's will need to be designed to
search and retrieve them.

*** Tools to use:

 Javascript, Web/OpenGL, Web components (ideally), Python programming and good s/w engineering skills.
