* Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition

** Overview and Motivation

   Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition is the Portable-Edition for
   Virtual Labs. It offers the offline version of Virtual labs,
   experiments and theoretical content. This edition addresses the
   lack of internet access or poor internet connectivity across
   different institutes/colleges. It results in a very cost-effective
   Learning Management System.

   Virtual Labs College Cloud Edition currently has about 70 labs (700+
   experiments) across multiple disciplines. It aims at providing remote
   access to labs for Science and Engineering students. Simulation based
   experimentation would now be possible without the internet
   facility. This initiative would make the labs developed by top
   technical institutes accessible to every college.
